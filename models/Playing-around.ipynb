Soldiers Billed for Thousands After Military Decides Not to Honor Decade-Old Enlistment Bonuses \\nHe told the audience that he was “humbled by this endorsement from true freedom fighters.” He also referenced the Damas en Blanco (Ladies in White), a “ Cuban dissident organization composed of the wives, mothers, daughters and sisters of political prisoners.” \\n“They march quietly to church every Sunday and … are subject to physical and verbal violence and abuse by government-sanctioned mobs,” Trump told the audience. He added that his opponent “turns a blind eye to the human rights violations that occur every single day.” \\nAs for the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association, a representative from the group called their endorsement a “no-brainer.”   \\nIn his introduction, the representative said that the group was concerned that “corruption in our public life has become rampant and has to be stopped. He also derided the “socialist progressive agenda of Hillary Clinton .” \\nYou can see Trump’s speech at the event here: \\nTrump has clearly shown that he’s on the side of the military, speaking out against Obama’s broken Department of Veterans Affairs, the shoddy treatment given to our veterans otherwise and the fact that our military gains have been reversed by administration policy.
